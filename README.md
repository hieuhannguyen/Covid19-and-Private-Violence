# Pandemic in Unsafe Homes: Covid-19 and Private Violence
## A Collaborative Final Project for 'Data Analysis and Visualization with Python'

### Abstract
This project examines the relaiontship between stay-at-home orders during Covid-19 and private violence (conflict between domestic partners and family members) across 52 states. After conducting data analysis with Python, we designed an infographic [Team13_FinalPoster.pdf](https://github.com/hieuhannguyen/Covid19-and-Private-Violence/blob/main/Team13_FinalPoster.pdf) detailing our findings and recommendations.

This project is divided into three parts:
1. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 1 - FBI CDE Data Crawling” is the code to crawl the data from the FBI CDE website. Please **don’t** rerun this part as it
will take a very long time (about 5 Hours).
2. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 2 - Data Cleaning and Merging” is the code to clean and merge crime, policy, and socioeconomic data.
3. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 3 - Data Visualization & Answer to Questions” shows the questions we want to answer and our plot interpretation. 

### Learning Reflection
I practiced exploratory methods for data analysis such as melting and pivoting, ploting, and building a correlation matrix. I also enjoyed the challenge of crafting a cohesive story from these datasets!

### Data Sources
1. ‘COVID-19 US state policy database (CUSP) - Stay at Home’: A .csv of stay-at-home order start date and end date across states, downloaded from the Covid-19 U.S. Policy database [link](https://statepolicies.com/).
2. ‘GDP_per_state_table’ and ‘personal_income_data’: Socioeconomic data we collected from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis [link](https://www.bea.gov/).
3. ‘relationship_2018-2022’: data we crawled from FBI Crime Data Explorer [link](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/).
