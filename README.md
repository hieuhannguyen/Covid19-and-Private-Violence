# Pandemic in Unsafe Homes: Covid-19 and Private Violence
## A Collaborative Final Project for 'Data Analysis and Visualization with Python'

### Abstract
This project examines the relaiontship between stay-at-home orders during Covid-19 and private violence (conflict between domestic partners and family members) across 52 states. After conducting data analysis with Python, we designed an infographic (Final_Poster.pdf)

This project is divided into three parts:
1. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 1 - FBI CDE Data Crawling” is the code to crawl the data from the FBI CDE website. Please **don’t** rerun this part as it
will take a very long time (about 5 Hours).
2. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 2 - Data Cleaning and Merging” is the code to clean and merge crime, policy, and socioeconomic data.
3. The Jupyter Notebook named “Part 3 - Data Visualization & Answer to Questions” shows the questions we want to answer and our plot interpretation.
